This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: improper handling of null values as function parameters.  The `bug.js` file shows an example where null is not explicitly handled, leading to potential issues. The `bugSolution.js` file presents a solution that checks for null values before proceeding with the function's logic.  This is a crucial step in writing robust and reliable JavaScript code.
